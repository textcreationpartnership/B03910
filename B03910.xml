            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Prince <hi>Johan, Chriſtian</hi> Duke of <hi>Lignitz</hi> and <hi>Brieg</hi> in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> had a Diſcourſe unto the Miniſters of the Goſpel of that Principality, in a Publick Aſſembly, in the Year 1627. Wherein he ſhewed them,</head>
            <p>THat the Lord had, by ſeveral National-plagues, manifeſted his Wrath againſt them, and that by reaſon of their Iniquities, being ſo hainous and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, it had now proceeded ſo far, that in all appearance there ſcarce would be found among them Ten Perſons truly Godly and Religious. That the People commonly did buſy themſelves with a kind of Worſhip, conſiſting only in hearing Sermons, receiving Sacraments, making a General Confeſſion of Sins, profeſſing a Willingneſs and Hope to be ſaved through the Merits of CHRIST, and promiſing of Repentance or Amendment of Life: But that they, at the Utmoſt, did only keep themſelves from External Groſs Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and rehearſed only Forms of Prayer, Morning and Evening, alſo before and after Meat; and that they imagined, after that manner, to attain to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, regarding nothing further, but wholly minding their Worldly Affairs. That the People did not well underſtand the Ten Commands, nor the LORD's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor Man's Miſery; nor what Difference there is betwixt Sin Indwelling only, and Sin having Dominion, betwixt a Living and a Dead Faith, betwixt the Letter and the Spirit; nor what the Love of GOD is, the Yoke of CHRIST, Regeneration, Self-denial, the Warfare betwixt the Fleſh and Spirit; and what Brokeneſs of Heart is; and how we ſhould <hi>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> That all this did in a great meaſure proceed from the Miniſters, who did not ſo acquit themſelves in their Charges as that any were Converted; That they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Miniſters did place All in hearing Sermons and receiving Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; That they did not ſeriouſly conſider how the People muſt be prepared for the LORD's Supper; That they reckoned to have well acquit themſelves when they have only Preached twice a Week, having in the mean time neglected the Principal Works, which is to ſpeak to the People in Particular, and at their ſeveral Dwelling-Houſes, and to ſearch and try them, teach, admoniſh and reprove them; and That they did not ſet before themſelves the right Scope in their undertaking the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Charge, and in their executing of it; That not one of Ten made the Building up of CHRIST's Kingdom his Principal End; That in their Meetings they had no right Scope and Aim, ſuch as the Diſcourſing of what occurs in Viſiting of Congregations; How Hearers of the Goſpel do acquit themſelves in Life and Converſation, and how Matters go as to Scandals and Offences That they laboured not to know how Young and Old underſtood, apply'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reduced into Practice, the Doctrine of the Catechiſm; That they did not themſelves lead an Examplary Life, nor had their Lives ſuited to their Doctrine; Yea, That they continued careleſs and ſecure, and would not ſo much as once conſider and learn, what were incumbent for them to do for bringing Matters to a better Paſs, while yet Experience did teach, that it cannot be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuated by ſuch general and ſuperficial Work. And that therefore; He did now propoſe to the Miniſters, this Queſtion to be more maturely Conſidered and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, How Means, appoſite and ſure, and in the preſent Juncture of time and State of the Church, practicable, might yet be fallen upon whereby the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Carnal Security may be effectually driven away, Lip-ſervice laid aſide, and Religion in Reality and Truth, truly acceptable unto GOD, planted among us, and tranſmitted to Poſterity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſame Prince thereafter did emit a Publick Edict amongſt his Subjects; Requiring every one, both Miniſters and People, and alſo the Magiſtrates to contribute their Endeavours for Reformation.</hi>
